# LightForge 2.2.3

Release candidate: validation and original-certificate signing must finish before publication.

This update addresses a native crash during Studio separation startup. A device diagnostic report records a native illegal-instruction exit immediately after the first passage starts. ONNX Runtime 1.23.2 has upstream reports of ARM CPU instruction-detection errors matching this class of failure. The report does not identify the exact failing function, so physical-device confirmation remains necessary.

## Changes

- Native Android ONNX Runtime is updated to checksum-pinned 1.25.1, including corrected SME2 capability detection.
- Studio uses the same complete model weights, passage context and numerical settings.
- A confirmed native-analysis crash activates compatibility processing on the next Resume for that app/runtime version. This uses the bundled WASM engine and the same Studio models. It may take longer. App/runtime upgrades permit native processing again.
- Saved rhythm work and completed passages remain available; no cache or project deletion is required by the update.
- Exported diagnostic logs now decode Android's binary native crash records, showing the signal, crashing library, relative instruction offset and available function names. Private paths, raw memory, audio and project contents remain excluded.
- Durable phase logs distinguish native library initialization, graph creation and the first graph execution.

## Validation

The matched development-host comparison produced bit-identical vocal and accompaniment samples with native runtime 1.23.2 and 1.25.1. This checks one reference passage, not general phone performance. Android lifecycle, native crash recovery and release packaging results are recorded in the source-bound verification files before publication.

Physical Samsung/Android 17 execution and Tesla timing remain unverified. Force-stop and device power restrictions still apply. Compatibility processing can require substantial time and memory.

## Installation and troubleshooting

The published update must retain the original LightForge signing certificate so it can install over the existing app without uninstalling. If a failure persists, use Guide → Export diagnostic log and attach the text file from Downloads/LightForge. Native exit traces depend on what Android retains.
